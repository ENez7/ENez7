Hi there, I'm Enrique and I love backend development using .NET. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge by learning Angular, with the goal
of becoming a more successful engineer. Also, I have developed many applications using Flutter as framework. I am driven by a passion for improvement
and excellence and I am enthusiastic about using new technologies and looking for new ways to do things. I am constantly seeking innovative solutions
to challenges and I am confident that my resilience is one of my key strengths.

That's all for now, may God be with you and He may bless you ðŸ‘¼
