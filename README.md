Hi there, I'm Enrique and currently I'm very interested in mobile development. I'm learning through the hybrid pathway
so you can be sure you'll see a lot of Flutter repos. Most of them are made just for fun or learn something specific. And maybe
just for skills demonstration. Ignore my commits' messages, I just don't know what to say for personal projects ðŸ¤”

Take a look at my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/ENez7)

Below you'll see a brief summary of languages I've worked with

And what I've earned up to this point ðŸ˜Ž and my failed attempts too (or see my stats)
